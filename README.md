# MNIST-Fashion Deep Learning Project

This project was part of the Kaggle mini-course on deep learning but I wanted to re-do it on my own machine and to try to improve on the model. In this project the [MNIST-Fashion dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist) is analyzed.   It is comprised of low-resolution photographs of articles from the [Zalando](.zalando.com) shop. The articles are categorized into 10 different categories of clothing.

The educational goal of this project was to learn to use computer vision deep learning models to categorize images. It was very interesting to learn the ins and outs of convolutions and on how computer vision models differ from other deep learning models, that are only made up of deep layers.

## Prerequisites

This project requires the Jupyter notebook containing the completed project, as well as the dataset. Unfortunately the dataset is for use on Github. It can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist).

To run this project, you will need `Jupyter Notebooks` with a python 3 kernel to be installed on your machine. Instructions on how to install `Jupyter Notebooks` can be found on the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install).

The project itself is written in Python 3 and uses the modules `Numpy`, `Keras` and `Tensorflow`to run. These can be installed by running `pip install <name of module>` in the console.
